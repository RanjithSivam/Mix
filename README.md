  - Create post with text and image
  - The number of characters in each post is limited to 200 characters
  - Like, comment and re-post a post
  - View the number of likes, comments and shares of a post
  - Comments are toggle
  - The number of character in each comment is limited to 100 characters
  - Follow, un-follow someone
  - See who are following us and follow them back
  - Check who we are following
  - View all posts of an individual
  - View our own posts
  - List all user accounts in the entire social network (due to the number of users are still small, I did not develop search user function)

  - Frontend: ReactJS, React Router, Material Ui
  - Backend: Java Spring Boot
  - Database: MySql
